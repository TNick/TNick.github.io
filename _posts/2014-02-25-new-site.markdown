My [old site](https://sites.google.com/site/tnickweb/home) got
pretty cluttered, so I decided to use [github's](https://github.com) offer with
[Jekyll][jekyll].

[Jekyll][jekyll] offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

and all you have to do is to add a file in the `_posts` 
directory that follows the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext`.

That's pretty awesome!. :)
